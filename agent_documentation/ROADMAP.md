## ðŸŽ¯ Next Up: Core Stability & Persistence

Our immediate focus is on hardening the app's foundation. This involves implementing robust data persistence for user settings and chat history, ensuring the app is stable and reliable.

| ID  | Task                                                            | Description                                                                                                |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| B-1 | **Persist Settings with DataStore**                             | Use Preferences DataStore to save the user's selected engine and system prompt, so they survive app restarts.  |
| C-1 | **Implement Context Safety**                                    | Prevent inference failures on long chats by implementing a simple message-count truncation (e.g., keep last 20). |
| D-1 | **Add Room for Chat History**                                   | Integrate the Room persistence library to store and retrieve chat messages locally.                        |
| D-2 | **Define Message Entity & DAO**                                 | Create the `MessageEntity`, Data Access Object (DAO), and `LocalAssistantDatabase` for Room.               |
| D-3 | **Load History in ViewModel**                                   | Hook the DAO into the `ChatViewModel` to load history on launch and handle chat resets.                    |
| E-1 | **UI Polish Pass**                                              | Align padding, typography, and colors with the Material 3 specification for a consistent look and feel.    |
| E-2 | **Implement Dark Theme**                                        | Ensure the UI looks great in both light and dark modes, respecting the system default setting.             |

## ðŸš€ Future Goals

Once the core experience is stable, we can focus on expanding the app's capabilities and improving the user experience.

- **Model Management:**
    - Implement a model browser to view available models.
    - Add support for background downloads with notifications.
    - Allow users to delete downloaded models.
- **Advanced Features:**
    - Explore and integrate more inference backends (e.g., different model types, hardware acceleration).
    - Implement token-based context truncation for more precise control.
- **Code Quality & Architecture:**
    - Refactor to a more modular architecture with feature modules.
    - Set up CI/CD pipelines with automated linting, static analysis (Detekt), and testing.
    - Conduct performance tuning to optimize resource usage.
